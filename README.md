DonateContract

DonateContract is a simple Solidity smart contract designed as a donation vault on EVM-compatible blockchains (e.g., used with the Hardhat + FHEVM template).
Its purpose is to allow anyone to send (donate) ETH (or the network’s native token) to the contract while keeping track of the total amount donated.

Key Features

Owner setup: When deployed, the contract assigns the owner (usually the deployer) with special privileges.

Donations: Anyone can send native tokens (ETH) to the contract via a payable donate function.

Tracking total donations: The contract stores and updates a totalDonations variable each time someone donates.

Withdrawal: The owner can withdraw or reclaim the donated funds (if a withdraw or similar function is implemented).

Events: The contract may emit events for every donation, making it easy to track donations off-chain or through a frontend.

Highlights

Built with Solidity ≥ 0.8.x, benefiting from built-in overflow protection and newer language security improvements.

Because the contract handles funds, ownership and withdrawal logic must be carefully controlled — only the authorized owner should be able to withdraw.

The code is intentionally simple — ideal as a boilerplate for small donation-based projects, hackathons, or tutorials.

Before deploying to mainnet:

Always test thoroughly on a testnet.

Consider adding extra security layers like withdrawal limits, time locks, or enhanced event logging.

Use standard access-control libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelin’s Ownable) for production.

Quick Usage

Clone the repository and open fhevm-hardhat-template/contracts/DonateContract.sol.

Review and modify variables or functions (for example, customize the owner or add more events).

Compile and test with Hardhat or your preferred framework.

Deploy to your target network (e.g., FHEVM, Ethereum testnet, or a local node).

Users can call the donate function to send ETH, while the owner can view or withdraw total funds.

Possible Extensions

Support ERC20 tokens in addition to native tokens.

Add fund release logic — conditional disbursement based on milestones, time, or donor count.

Build a simple frontend UI for one-click donations.

Include audit and security review before real-world deployment.
